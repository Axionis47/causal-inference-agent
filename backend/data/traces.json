      "reasoning": "This is the first step in our causal analysis workflow since no metadata is available to extract domain knowledge from. The data profiler will give us essential understanding of the dataset structure, identify potential causal variables, and assess data quality - all critical foundations before proceeding with EDA and causal discovery. The Iris dataset is typically used for classification, so we need to carefully evaluate if it contains variables suitable for causal inference.",
      "inputs": {
        "task": "Perform comprehensive data profiling of the Iris dataset. Analyze the dataset structure, variable types, distributions, and data quality. Identify potential treatment and outcome variables for causal analysis. Since this is the famous Iris flower dataset, pay attention to whether there are variables that could represent interventions or treatments (like different growing conditions, fertilizers, etc.) versus natural characteristics. Assess the dataset's overall suitability for causal inference and provide recommendations for next steps."
